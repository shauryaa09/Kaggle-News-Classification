This notebook contains solution to an assignment on unsupervised learning using matrix factorization.
The assignment instructions are:
Part 1:

For this week’s mini-project, you will participate in this Kaggle competition:  

Kaggle Competition: BBC News Classification 
 [80 pts]

This Kaggle competition is about categorizing news articles. You will use matrix factorization to predict the category and submit your notebook for peer evaluation. 

The part has 80 points. The instructions summarize the criteria you will use to guide your submission and review others’ submissions. 

You will submit one deliverable for Part 1: 

A Jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, model building and training, and comparison with supervised learning. 

Suppose your work becomes so large that it doesn’t fit into one notebook (or you think it will be less readable by having one large notebook). In that case, you can make several notebooks or scripts in a GitHub repository (as deliverable 3) and submit a report-style notebook or pdf instead.

Part 2:

Limitation(s) of sklearn’s non-negative matrix factorization library. [20 pts]

1. Load the movie ratings data (as in the HW3-recommender-system) and use matrix factorization technique(s) and predict the missing ratings from the test data. Measure the RMSE. You should use sklearn library. [10 pts]


2. Discuss the results and why sklearn's non-negative matrix facorization library did not work well compared to simple baseline or similarity-based methods we’ve done in Module 3. (These gave a RMSE of 1.26 or less.) Can you suggest a way(s) to fix it? [10 pts]
